# Loan Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the status of loan applications based on a dataset provided on Kaggle. The repository includes the implementation of a machine learning pipeline for training and predicting loan statuses, a FastAPI for serving predictions, and a Streamlit frontend for user interaction.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into various modules:

- **prediction_model/config**: Contains configuration files.
- **prediction_model/datasets**: Includes the training and testing datasets.
- **prediction_model/processing**: Contains data handling and preprocessing scripts.
- **prediction_model/trained_models**: Stores the trained model artifacts.
- **prediction_model**: Main module with pipeline and prediction scripts.
- **tests**: Contains unit tests for the prediction module.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Loan Status Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/loan-status-prediction). It includes various features related to loan applications and their statuses.

##Data
The data corresponds to a set of financial requests associated with individuals.

## FastAPI

The project includes a FastAPI implementation for serving predictions. You can find more details in its [README.md file](https://github.com/Ayush04H/Loan-Predication/blob/main/packaging-ml--model/Loan_pred_Api/Readme.md).

## Streamlit Frontend

A Streamlit frontend is also provided for user interaction with the prediction model. More details are available in its [README.md file](https://github.com/Ayush04H/Loan-Predication/blob/main/packaging-ml--model/Loan_pred_frontend/Readme.md).

## Setup Instructions

To clone and set up the repository in a new virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Ayush04H/Loan-Predication.git
    cd Loan-Predication
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    - On Windows:

        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the training pipeline**:
    ```sh
    python prediction_model/training_pipeline.py
    ```

6. **Make predictions**:
    ```sh
    python prediction_model/predict.py
    ```
